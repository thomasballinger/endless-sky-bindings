Do the TypeScript types work? Need to check.

The two builds now work pretty differently: the node build uses the native filesystem!

How do you make requiring this not need the extra file path in

    import {libFactory} from 'endless-sky-bindings/dist/es-node.js'

Should get tests running on packed artifact because the bundling+publishing is error-prone

Should get tests running on Windows, since using the native filesystem means all those inconsistencies are going to happen!
 
The right way to do the import("../dist/es-lib.js") thing seems to be a plugin https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/456
(it should be import("./es-lib.js) and from * as eslib import "./es-lib.js")

It turns out NODERAWFS doesn't quite work yet: https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/7487
I've opened a PR to fix, but in the meantime this library should use NODEFS and manually mount things.
- mount resources at /resources or something
- mount config at /config or something



Should lib-web.js and lib-node.js, the 400kB files output by emscripten, be in src or dist?
Shoudl the be referenced in src or dist?
