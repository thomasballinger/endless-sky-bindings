Do the TypeScript types work? Need to check.

The two builds now work pretty differently: the node build uses the native filesystem!

How do you make requiring this not need the extra file path in

    import {libFactory} from 'endless-sky-bindings/dist/es-node.js'

Check Observable after publishing!

Should get tests running on packed artifact because the bundling+publishing is error-prone
