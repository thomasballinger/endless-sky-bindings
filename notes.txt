Do the TypeScript types work? Need to check.

The two builds now work pretty differently: the node build uses the native filesystem!

How do you make requiring this not need the extra file path in

    import {libFactory} from 'endless-sky-bindings/dist/es-node.js'

Check Observable after publishing!

Should get tests running on packed artifact because the bundling+publishing is error-prone

Should get tests running on Windows, since using the native filesystem means all those inconsistencies are going to happen!
 
The right way to do the import("../dist/es-lib.js") thing seems to be a plugin https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/456
