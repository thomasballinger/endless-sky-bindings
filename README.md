# JavaScript bindings for Endless Sky C++ code

JavaScript wrapper for the C++ classes in [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky), compiled to JavaScript + WebAssembly by Emscripten.

```sh
npm install endless-sky-bindings
```


## Usage examples

Use as a ES6 Module in node:
```js
import libFactory from "endless-sky-bindings/dist/es-node.js";

(async function () {
  const esLib = await libFactory();
  console.log(new esLib.Point(1, 2));
})();
```

Use in a browser script tag, without a bundler:

```html
<script type="module">
(async function() {
  const {default: esLibFactory} = await import('https://unpkg.com/endless-sky-bindings/dist/es-web.mjs?module');
  const esLib = await esLibFactory();
  esLib.GameDataBeginLoad([]); // optional
  console.log(new esLib.Point(1, 2));
})();
</script>
```

Use in the node REPL (shown with top-level await which is on by default in node 16, for node <16 use `node --experimental-repl-await`):

```sh
> const {default: libFactory} = await import('endless-sky-bindings/dist/es-node.js');
> const esLib = await libFactory();
> p = new esLib.Point(1, 2));
Point {}
> p.X();
1
```

## Wrapped classes

See [lib.cpp](./lib.cpp) for which classes are wrapped. It's not hard to add more. Reading the [Endless Sky source](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky) for respective methods is the only documentation available.

## How this works

This repository has a specific commit of Endless Sky as a submodule. A patch (patch.diff) is applied to it, mostly to make it compile with the Emscripten toolchain. This patch is based on the changes made to Endless Sky in the [Endless Web](https://github.com/thomasballinger/endless-web) fork.

These modified Endless Sky C++ files are compiled with Emscripten with bindings in lib.cpp made possibly by the Emscripten [embind](https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/connecting_cpp_and_javascript/embind.html) macros.

These distributed files include core Endless Sky game data, but not images or sounds.

## Potential Uses of this library
These aren't all possible yet, but this is the motivation. If you're trying to do something like these, let me know!

* npm-installable command line data parser which exactly mirrors game loading logic
* live preview of derived properties when making data file changes
* GUI ship editor that produces data files for plugin authors
* text editor tool providing autocompletion and syntax highlighting when writing data files
* "fly this ship around" widget that embeds the full game on a webpage with tweakable stats/outfits
* player assistance tools displaying game information live as it is played
* online mission editor tool
* deep linking to game situations more specific than a savefile
* hooks into game logic for customization of https://play-endless-web.com from JavaScript
